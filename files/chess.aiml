  <template>Chess is a strategic board game played between two players on a square checkered board. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting it in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture. Each player starts with 16 pieces, including a king, a queen, rooks, knights, bishops, and pawns. Each piece has its own unique way of moving across the board. The game combines tactical thinking, foresight, and planning as players aim to outmaneuver their opponents and create favorable positions. Chess is widely played and enjoyed worldwide, with numerous variations, tournaments, and a rich history dating back centuries.</template>
